## B.O.B Discord Bot
B.O.B is a Discord bot, written in Python, powered by the Discord.py library.
BOB's sole purpose is to provide differing functions for the LoneStar Gaming Community Discord.
(Currently the Discord is not public, but will be in the far future when the bot and server
are finished.)

If you wish to fork this bot and make it your own, you *must* credit me(AgentLoneStar007) as the
original creator. And please note: this bot is designed for use in one Discord server. It will
probably break if used on more than one. And it's also not designed to be user-friendly for someone
making their own bot, and it most likely never will. You'll have to read through the code and modify
it to make this bot your own.
